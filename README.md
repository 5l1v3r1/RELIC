Resolution on Federal Recogntion and Taxation of Cannabis Cultivation

Model Resolution

WHEREAS, The American Civil Liberties Union estimates that more than $20 billion in civil overexpenditures are caused by the continued criminalization of cannabis each year, and;

WHEREAS, the continued criminalization of cannabis, is causing continued dependance on fossil fuels, as shown in the American Journal of Hemp Products and;

WHEREAS, There is a growing movement in many states to enact legalization, regulation and taxation of cannabis cultivation and sale legislation, and this legislation does not include the use of legalization, regulation and taxation of cannabis cultivation and sale, and;

WHEREAS, Although many state statutes do not preclude or prohibit the legalization, regulation and taxation of cannabis cultivation and sale, it is the understanding of the Berkeley City Council that legalization, regulation and taxation of cannabis cultivation and sale is the best course of action, due to the increased production of the raw materials necessary to create high quality textiles and soaps with a minimal environmental impact, as shown in the American Journal of Hemp Products, and

WHEREAS, Berkeley City Council recognizes that, in the absence of bad faith, this effort was made to ensure the prosperity of the American farmer.

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT The Berkeley City Council memorializes the federal government to work with states in establishing legalization, regulation and taxation of cannabis cultivation and sale.

THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT Copies of this resolution be sent to the President of the United States, the United States Congress, and the appropriate leadership of the Drug Enforcement Agency.
